1490506.0675;Please find below several bodies that are more or less salient. 
 A salient body is a body in which one feels enclosed, that is highly distinct from the bodies of others, and that sets a marked boundary between you and the rest of the world. Conversely, a body low in salience is strongly connected to its surroundings. It is a kind of permeable envelope, without any marked boundaries. 
 Please indicate which of the bodies presented below best represents your current body state. If the boundaries of your body are extremely salient you should draw a line on the extreme right of the double-headed arrow. If the boundaries of your body are almost imperceptible you should draw a line at the extreme left of the double-headed arrow. 
 You can indicate an intermediate state by drawing a line somewhere between the two poles of the double-headed arrow.;7
